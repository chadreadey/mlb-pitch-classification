# mlb-pitch-classification
ðŸ‘¥ Project Background & Contributions
This project was originally developed in collaboration with Carli Kelley and Garner Hasler as part of a joint effort to explore machine learning techniques for MLB pitch classification.

The original codebase and initial analysis were co-authored, and I have been granted permission to host a copy of the work here on my GitHub to showcase and continue iterating on the project. This version may include updates, refinements, or extensions that reflect my personal contributions and learning.
